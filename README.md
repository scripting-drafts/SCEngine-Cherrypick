## Harmony Engines and Scrapers

### Music Engine
Big disclaimer; I keep switching between midi ports:
 - Change int in line 45 to 0 in order to preview music,  
 side-chain the engine to a DAW with 1  
To midi-sync Cubase add an empty "EnableGSSynth.txt" to C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Steinberg\Cubase 14_64
    
### SuperCollider Engine
 - Test it with the test example  
    
To do:  
 - MIDI format melody rolls
