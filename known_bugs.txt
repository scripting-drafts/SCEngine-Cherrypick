Fixed bugs:
 - 259: s = s + [x + 12 for x in s if x != 0] + [x + 24 for x in s if x != 0]
    This is not apppropiated for all scales - Workaround on range_increments
  
Known bugs:
 - Bending trajectory not displayed
 - Doubts with timer
 - Bars need to be set at 32, cause 16 means 8
 - The length of a beat per Timer is 4 times less than it shall be?
